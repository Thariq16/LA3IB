# How to View Diagrams

Since the local viewer is unable to render the diagrams, you can copy the code blocks from the markdown files and paste them into the **Mermaid Live Editor** to generate high-quality images.

## Instructions
1.  Open [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) in your browser.
2.  Open the desired markdown file (`MVP_ROADMAP_DIAGRAM.md` or `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`).
3.  Copy the code between the \`\`\`mermaid and \`\`\` blocks.
4.  Paste it into the editor on the left side of the website.
5.  You can then view the diagram and download it as PNG or SVG using the "Actions" menu.
